Lab 4.4 : Phoenix basics
========================

### Overview
Perform basic Phoenix operations

Note: Phoenix installed on our Hadoop cluster. For this lab, we recommend using it. However, you can continue
working with your Phoenix install that you have created in Lab 4.1

### Builds on
None

### Run time
approx. 20 minutes

### Working directory
`hadoop-adv-labs/4-hbase/`

### STEP 1: Connect to Phoenix     
To start the Phoenix shell, called `sqlline`, on the Ambari cluster you use the following command
     
```bash
    $  ~/phoenix/bin/sqlline.py   <internal-ip-of-zookeeper>:2181:/hbase-unsecure
```
     
For example, your command may like as follows
```bash 
     $   ~/phoenix/bin/sqlline.py    localhost:2181:/hbase-unsecure
     # or 
     $   ~/phoenix/bin/sqlline.py    ip-10-16-184-103.ec2.internal:2181:/hbase-unsecure
```
     

Note: how do you know to use /hbase-unsecure? It should be /hbase?!
This depends on the ZooKeeper setup with HBase. In HortonWorks install, it is /hbase-unsecure. To verify, connect to the ZooKeeper using
     
```bash
     $   /usr/hdp/current/zookeeper-client/bin/zkCli.sh
     zk>   ls / 

     #  you will see
     /hbase or /hbase-unsecure and other /nodes
```
     
### STEP 2: Basic operations

In the `sqlline` shell, do this
    
```
    create table <your-name>_test (mykey integer not null primary key, mycolumn varchar);
    upsert into <your-name>_test values (1, 'Hello');
    upsert into <your-name>_test values (2, 'World');
    select * from <your-name>_test;
```
    
You should get this output
```console
    
    +------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
    |                  MYKEY                   |                 MYCOLUMN                 |
    +------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
    | 1                                        | Hello                                    |
    | 2                                        | World                                    |
    +------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
```

List all tables:

```
    phonix > !tables
```    
    
### STEP 3: Investigate `sqlline` 
```
    phonix > help
```
    
Inspect help and play with the commands. NOTE the <TAB>, which helps expands the commands you are entering.
    
### STEP 4: 

Open the HBase shell again and view the table(s) you have created with Phoenix. Can you explain the details?

```bash
    $   hbase  shell

    hbase> 
            # to see all tables
            list

            # scan data in a table
            scan 'table name'
```
